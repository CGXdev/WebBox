# WebBox
WebBox is a lightweight web browser, it is unfinished and therefore contains many bugs, some of which have been found, but many have not been found. It will remain closed source all throughout its development, it is incompatible with many modern web standards, hence the fact that most websites will either not work or will have very scarce functionality.

## Installation
Download the WebBox executable (WebBox.exe), run it and enjoy!

## Sumary
WebBox is a project browser, it is not fit for daily usage and instead is a project browser, I may use it as the basis for future projects. I will keep addding to the project in the near future, enjoy!
